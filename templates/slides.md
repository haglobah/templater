Functional Programming is a <em>programming style</em> in which one models the real world as a <em>pure function</em>.

</v-click>
<v-click>

You can write a functional program in almost every languageâ€”all you need are [first class functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function).

</v-click>
<v-click>

[Closures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36636/what-is-a-closure), <em>immutable data structures</em> and <em>recursion</em> help, too.

</v-click>
<v-click>

A functional program is more <em>declarative</em>, [simpler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) and less <em>coupled</em> <em>by default.</em>

</v-click>
<v-click>

Especially if you have some previous programming experience before, Functional Programming [feels weird](https://paulgraham.com/avg.html) in the beginning.

</v-click>
<v-click>

That's probably due to you coming from [Turing Machine](https://samwho.dev/turing-machines/)-based programing languages. Functional programming stems from the <em>Lambda Calculus</em> and is ... different.
